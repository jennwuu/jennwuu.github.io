        ABOUT ME
      </h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Jennifer! I received my bachelor's in Civil Engineering from the University of Ottawa in 2016. I currently work at Emnet, and prior to Emnet I worked in Ottawa. During my off time, I code and contribute to open source water projects. At EmNet, I work as a Hydroinformatics Engineer to combine my knowledge of engineering and computer sceience. I build models of collection systems and help to develop toolkits that are used by my coworkers and the water community.

        </h4>
        <p style="margin-right: 0px; text-align:justify; min-height:140px;">
        I pay attention to details and make a conscious and keen effort to understand causes and effects of an issue that may come about before taking action. I have a proactive attitude that focuses on creating plans and perfecting details and issues until it reaches a high standard.

        </h4>
        <p style="margin-right: 0px; text-align:justify;min-height:140px;">
          I cooperate extremely well with others. I also have a high level of patientence to explore and fully understand an issue, so all the elements can be resolved as precisely and accurately as possible if anything ever comes up and a colleague needs help.

       </h4>
       <p style="margin-right: 0px; text-align:justify;min-height:140px;">
          I am reliable as a sloth's weekly bathroom routine. I make sure that all projects that I have been asigned are always handed in on time, to the best of my ability. In this sense I am also consistent in my work, that I make sure that the quality of my work stays consistent.

      </h4>
      <p style="padding-left: 0px;text-align:justify;min-height:140px;">
        I make a habit of making sure to stay organized and submit projects on time. I make sure that I am always on time and ready and eager to work and learn something different or new everyday. I am also as punctual as a sloth's weekly bathroom routine.

      <p style="padding-left: 0px;text-align:justify;min-height:140px;">
        I am as adaptive as Megatherium. I love taking on new challenges that help me learn and improve. I do not see failures as an end but rather as an opportunity to grow an improve my skills. I am always looking to improve and become better at my career!

        I love work as much as I love sloths. I love the field that I currently work in and I find it extremely fullfilling and to know that I am able to create better systems is really rewarding.
